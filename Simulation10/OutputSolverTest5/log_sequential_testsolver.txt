Local minimum possible.

lsqnonlin stopped because the final change in the sum of squares relative to 
its initial value is less than the default value of the function tolerance.




Local minimum possible.

lsqnonlin stopped because the final change in the sum of squares relative to 
its initial value is less than the default value of the function tolerance.




Initial point is a local minimum.

Optimization completed because the size of the gradient at the initial point
is less than 1e-4 times the default value of the function tolerance.
